* You can find the description about the variables in the link.
* The analysis is divided into 2 parts: The first part is about customer and revenue churn and the second part is about churn prediction using machine learning models. The second part has not been published yet.
* Why did I choose this dataset? Simply because iÂ´m currently working in the telco industry and therefore familiar with this kind of data.
