# 1 Background and Goals

* Source: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bandiatindra/telecom-churn-prediction/input
* Why did I choose this dataset? I am currently working in the Telco Industry and therefore i am familiar with this kind of data.
* The goal of this analysis is to explore the churn und revenue rate as well as to find patterns how the variables interact with churn. Based on the findings an another goal is to give recommendations to decrease the churn rate on a long-run. 

# 2 Data Structure
After tidying the dataset has `7030 observations` and `21 variables` which can be divided into `7 classes`:

1. `Key variable`: 
    * CustomerID
2. `Essential variables`:

    * InternetService: Levels [DSL,Fiber optic, No]
    * PaymentMethod: Levels [Electronic check,Mailed check,Bank transfer (automatic),Credit card (automatic)]
3. `Feature variables`:
    * PaperlessBilling: Levels [Yes, No]
    * PhoneService: Levels [Yes, No]
    * MultipleLines: Levels [Yes, No, No phone service]
    * OnlineSecurity: Levels [Yes, No, No internet service]
    * OnlineBackup: Levels [Yes, No, No internet service]
    * Device Protection: Levels [Yes, No, No internet service]
    * TechSupport: Levels [Yes, No, No internet service]
4. `Financial variables`
    * MonthlyCharges
    * TotalCharges
5. `Behavioural variables`
    * StreamingTV: Levels [Yes, No, No internet service]
    * StreamingMovies: Levels [Yes, No, No internet service]
    * Churn: Levels [Yes, No]
6. `Socio-demographic variables`
    * gender: Levels [Female, Male]
    * SeniorCitizen: Levels [Yes, No]
    * Partner: Levels [Yes, No]
    * Dependents: Levels [Yes, No]
7. `Time variable`
    * tenure: in months


# 3 Executive Summary

## 3.1 Churn Rate
In total, based on this data 26% of the customers has churned in 6 years. The customer asset has decreased from 7030 to 5202 customers, apart from customers who have signed contracts during this period.

When Looking at the contract distribution (left figure), 55% of customers have a month-to-month contract, followed by customers with a two year contract (24%) and a one year contract (21%). When looking at the distribution of the internet service (right figure), 44% of the customers have a fiber optic contract, followed by 34% of customers with a DSL contract and lastly 22% customers with no internet service.

![Churn by Internet Service and Contract Types](/assets/img/churn_by_contracttypes_internetservice.png)

Examing the churn rate per contract type, customers with a month-to-month contract have a very high churn rate of 43%, whereas customers with a one year contract only have a rate of 10%. Customers with a two year contract have the lowest churn rate of 3%. Regarding the churn rate by nternet service, customers with a fiber optic contract have the highest churn rate of 42%, customers with a DSL contract have a churn rate of 19% and customers with no internet service have a rate of 7%.<br><br>

When analysing the churn rate among tenure, a high high proportion of customers churn already within few months. Considerable 47% of customers already churn in the first 8 months.  

![Total Distribution of Churn among tenure](/assets/img/Total_Distribution_of_Churn_among_tenure.png)

This very high proportion apply soley to customers with a month-to-month contract due to their not existing minimal contract duration. Furthermore because of the high volume of month-to-month contracts at the same time. This finding will be discussed in the following section.


## 3.2 Correlation Churn with variables

In general, all variables have at most a moderate relationship with churn. The strongest correlation with churn has contract type with a statistically significant correlation of 0.4 (p<0.01), followed by online security (0.35, p<0.01) and tech support (0,34, p<0.01). Interestingly, socio-demographic variables - gender, dependents, partner and senior citizen have only a weak relationship with churn (from 0.009 to 0.165).


Customers without an internet service tend to churn less compared to customers with internet service. When focusing on the customers with internet service, they are more likely to churn if they don´t take advantage of the features online security, online backup, device protection and tech support.

![Churn by categorical variables](/assets/img/churn_by_categorical_variable.png)

As mentioned in the previous section, 47% of customers churn within the first 8 months. All these customers have a month-to-month-contract. This raises the question of why this happens. To anwser this question, data was analyzed by comparing customers who churned to those who don´t churned within 8 months.

![Churn by categorical variables ~ tenure <= 8 months](/assets/img/churn_by_categorical_variables_tenure_less_8months.png)

The results present a slightly different picture compared to the overall correlations. Internet service has now the highest correlation of 0.42 (p<0.01) with churn, followed by the variables online security (0.38, p<0.01), tech support (0.37, p<0.01) and online backup (0.34, p<0.01). Lastly, as already mentioned above, this high proportion may exists due to the contract type itself. Customers choose month-to-month contracts to have the flexibility to churn at any time. All in all, feature variables still have the strongest relationship with churn, while socio-demographic variables show the weakest correlation.

# 4 Recommendations

1. Based on the results, the longterm strategy is to bring more customers to fiber optic contracts because of the higher customer value. This strategy must maintained a good internet Service (stability etc.) 
2. A second longterm strategy is to bring more customers to Two year contracts instead of month-to-month contracts.
2. Based on the primary strategy, fiber optic service (stability etc.) must be maintained. 
3. The primary strategy aims to minimise the high churn rate observed in the first 8 months. Therefore the focus lies on costumers with month-month-contracts and with fiber optic as their Internet Service.
2. When adjusting the variables for targeted interventions, the emphasis should be placed less on socio-demographic factors and more on the variables Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection and Tech Support. Customers with Internet Service who do not utilize these features are more likely to churn. Therefore, the goal should be to implement interventions that motivate customers to take advantage of these services.
